h1. Clipboard Scripts

A collection of scripts that operate on the OSX pasteboard.
I trigger these from Quicksilver, but they'd work from Google Quick Search Box
or any other launcher capable of launching shell scripts.

h2. ToDo

* would (this):http://github.com/janlelis/clipboard make these tools cross-platform?

h2. Install

# Invoke Quicksilver
# <code><Command><,></code> (for preferences)
# Catalog
# Click the '+' in the bottom left and add a File & Folder Scanner
# Select the bin subdirectory of this directory
# Click the small 'i' in the bottom right
# "Include Contents:" Folder Contents (Depth: 2)
# Command r (to rescan catalog)
