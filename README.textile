h1. Clipboard Scripts

A collection of scripts that operate on the OSX pasteboard.
I trigger these from Quicksilver, but they'd work from Google Quick Search Box
or any other launcher capable of launching shell scripts.

h2. ToDo

* would "this":http://github.com/janlelis/clipboard make these tools cross-platform?

h2. Prerequisites

@ruby@, @rubygems@
(you could get those through "MacPorts":http://www.macports.org/install.php with @sudo port install rb-rubygems ruby@)

h3. Prerequisites (â€¦ less geeky version)

# [skippable if you've already installed Quicksilver] download and install "Quicksilver":http://github.com/downloads/tiennou/blacktree-alchemy/Quicksilver-b57-3840.tar.gz/qr_code
# Invoke Quicksilver and hit @<Command><,>@ (hold the squiggly apple key and tap the comma key) to get to the preferences panel
# click to Plugins and check the "Terminal Module" plugin
# [skippable if you've already installed it] download and install "MacPorts":http://www.macports.org/install.php
# from Terminal.app:
  @$ sudo port install rb-rubygems ruby git-core@
  (rubygems and ruby are for Ruby scripts, git-core is the git source code versioning system)
  @$ makedir ~/code@
  @$ cd ~/code@
  @$ git clone git://github.com/matthewfallshaw/clipboard-scripts.git@
  @$ cd clipboard-scripts@
  @$ ./install.rb@
  (say 'a' to accept everything)
  @$ cat README@
  (follow those instructions)
# now (and always):
## select and copy any text which has formatting
## Invoke Quicksilver
## type enough of @pb-unformat@ to let Quicksilver find that script (probably just @unformat@)
   now you have completely unformated text in the clipboard 

h2. Install

# @./install.rb@ from this directory (and 'a' to accept everything)
# Invoke Quicksilver
# @<Command><,>@ (for preferences)
# Catalog
# Click the '+' in the bottom left and add a File & Folder Scanner
# Select the bin subdirectory of this directory
# Click the small 'i' in the bottom right
# "Include Contents:" Folder Contents (Depth: 2)
# Command r (to rescan catalog)
